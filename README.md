# STIFF-VRShowcase
This was a VR 360 video application for STIFF 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle%27s_True_Independent_Film_Festival

What makes this different from other VR video applications is the external controls provided for festival attendants.
The main idea is that the viewer just puts on the headset and worries about nothing else, just like a movie theater.
A volunteer helps a participant put on the headset, and there is a 3D environment to help the participant get settled. 
Afterwhich, when the participant is ready, the volunteer controls the film and can play, pause, and reset a selected film.
